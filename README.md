# WynnTrans Language Pack

This is a translation resource pack used by the [WynnTrans](https://github.com/Hexagreen/WynnTrans) project, a third-party i18n project for the Minecraft MMORPG Server: Wynncraft.

## Description

This resource pack contains translation files for the Wynncraft server, used by the WynnTrans mod. It allows in-game text to be displayed in multiple languages based on the player's selected language.

## Version

- Minecraft 1.21.4 Resource Pack

## Installation

1. Ensure that the **WynnTrans mod** is installed.
2. Place the resource pack in your Minecraft client's **resourcepacks** folder.
3. Before connecting to a server, activate the resource pack through Minecraft's settings.

## Usage

When used with the [WynnTrans](https://github.com/Hexagreen/WynnTrans) mod, in-game text will be displayed in the available languages corresponding to the text's entries.

## Contributing

You can contribute by submitting translations and reviews via **Pull Requests**.  
For **Korean translations**, the project maintainer may conduct additional reviews.  
For other languages, individual translations are allowed, but due to the large amount of text and concerns about community reception and vandalism prevention, it is highly recommended to provide translations in collaboration with a group.
